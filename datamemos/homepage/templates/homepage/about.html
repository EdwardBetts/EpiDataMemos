	<p>This website was inspired by the Annual HIV/AIDS Epidemiology Report that is published by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. This report contains current metrics about HIV in San Francisco, and attempts create a narrative about what the numbers mean. The exact content of each report changes, based on special studies being done the the HIV Surveillance Section and common questions that are asked by community members and groups. Over the years, this report has become an important resource for everyone from high school students to the Office of the Mayor, and is cited by researchers at a national level.</p>
